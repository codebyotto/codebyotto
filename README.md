# Hi there, I'm Otto 👋  
*Student and code tinkerer exploring OOP and beyond.*

## About Me
🚀 Currently a student diving into programming, experimenting with object-oriented paradigms, and trying out different languages and frameworks. I love building projects just for the fun of it and learning as I go.  

💡 My motto: *"Try, break, learn, repeat."*  

🏎️ Outside of coding, I’m passionate about cars and bikes—they fuel my creativity and keep me inspired.

## Skills & Interests
- Object-Oriented Programming (Java, Python, C#… still exploring!)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS basics)
- Experimenting with frameworks & tools
- Algorithm design & problem solving
- Project prototyping and fun side projects

## Projects
Here are a few projects I’m currently working on or experimenting with:  
- **Multiplayer Card Game** – Web interface + backend server, testing AI strategies  
- **Miscellaneous Fun Experiments** – Trying out different languages and frameworks

## Let’s Connect
I’m always open to collaboration, sharing ideas, or just chatting about code, cars, or bikes!
